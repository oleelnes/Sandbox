## Code video
"code that is tightinly/tightly? integrated with the game engine that is difficult to see from the text of the programming."

## Group discussion
* Strengths and weaknesses of engine we used in our game
* How we controlled process and communication systems during development
* Use of version control systems, ticket tracking, branching, version control


## Individual discussions
* A link to, and discussion of, code you consider good
* A link to, and discussion of, code you consider bad
* A personal reflection about the key concepts you learnt during the course
* Code involvement


For code involvement the interaction rules are:
Anyone can claim to have “Touched” code. This would involve as little as single line debugging. You would only mention this if the input was significant for the project, but very small in actual change in code.
If you claim you did “All” of a part of code no one else can claim “Most”, “Half”, or “Some”, any group member can claim they touched the code.
If you claim you did “Most” then others cannot claim “All”, “Most”, or “Half” but up to half the group (N/2) can claim “Some” work.
If you claim “Half” then others cannot claim “All” or “Most”, but one (1) other can claim “Half” and any number of the group (N) can claim “Some” or “Touched” Others

| | # claim |Others| All	| Most | Half | Some | Touched |
|----|----|-|----|----|----|----|----|
| All	| 1 || 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | N |
| Most | 1 || 0 | 0 | 0 | N | N |
| Half | 2 || 0 | 0 | 1 | N | N |
| Some | N || 0 | 1 | 1 | N | N |
| Touched | N || 1 | 1 | 2 | N | N |
